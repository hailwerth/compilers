The algorithm goes:
1. int returnAddr = labelNumber
2. push #returnAddr (note: preprocessing for DISM will resolve the value) onto the stack
3. push the caller onto the stack (e.g.,"this" or "e" of e.id)
4. Null-dereference check for  e IF it exists (e.id case)
5. find and push class and method #'s (for "id")
6. CG @ arg
7. push #args
8. jump to Vtable
9. *#returnAddr: mov 0 0
